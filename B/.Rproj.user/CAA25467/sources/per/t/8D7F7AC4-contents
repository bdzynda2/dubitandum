## Preliminary Review from Last Lecture

Consider environment:
$$\epsilon = ( T \cup B, (\succsim)_{i \in T \cup B} )$$

And Matching:
$$\mu: (T \cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$$


__DA Algorithm__ (T-propsal)

+ $k$ proposals $\hat{P}^k: T \rightarrow B \cup \{\emptyset\}$
+ $k$ tentative accept $\hat{\mu}^k: B \rightarrow T \cup \{\emptyset\}$
+ $\hat{\mu}^k = \hat{\mu}^{k+1}$


__Definition__: $\mu^*:(T \cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$ is _I-Optimal Stable match_ if 

1. $\mu^*$ is stable
2. $\mu^* \ge_I \mu$ for all stable $\mu$


$\mu^* >_I \mu$ if for all $i \in I$ $\mu^* \ge_I \mu$ and for some $i \in I: \mu^*(i) \succ_i \mu(i)$




## Proposition (Thm 2.12 in Roth, Sotomayor?):

_Suppose preferences are strict. Then for each $I \in \{T,B\}$ the match $\mu^*_{ID}:(T \cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$ is an I-optimal stable match._



__Definition__: Say $b$ is acheivable for $t$ if there exists some stable match $\mu$ with $\mu(b) = t$. 



## Lemma 1: 

_In the T-proposal DA algorithm, the following holds for each $k=1,2,...$ : If $\hat{P}^k(t) = b$ and $b$ is acheivable for $t$, then $\hat{\mu}^k(b) = t$_




__Proof__:


Suppose the result is not true. Then there exists some $k$ such that:

1. for each $l < k$ and each $t \in T$: if $\hat{P}^l(t)=b$ and $b$ is acheivable for $t$, then $\hat{\mu}^l(b) = t$
2. There is some $t^* \in T$ such that $\hat{P}^k(t^*) = b^*$, $b^*$ is acheivable for $t^*$ and $\hat{\mu}^k (b^*) \ne t^*$

There is stable matching $\mu:(T \cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$ with $\mu(t^*) = b^*$. That is to say, $b^*$ is acheivable for $t^*$. 

Now, $\hat{\mu}^k(b^*) \ne t^* \implies t^{**} = \hat{\mu}^k(b^*)$ and $t^* \ne t^{**}$


Observe $\mu(t^{**}) \ne b^*$


Will show: $(t^{**}, b^*)$ blocks $\mu$, contradicting the fact that $\mu$ is stable. Precisely, two points of proof:

### First: $t^{**} \succ_{b^*} \mu(b^*)$


To show: $t^{**} \succ_{b^*} \mu(b^*)$ Let:
$$\hat{P}^k(t^{*}) = \hat{P}^k(t^{**}) = b^*$$
$$\hat{\mu}^k(b^*) = t^{**} \succ_{b^*} t^* = \mu(b^*)$$





### Second: $b^* \succ_{t^{**}} \mu(t^{**})$

$b^* \succ_{t^{**}} \mu(t^{**})$

Want to show that for each $l < k$, $\mu(t^{**}) \ne \hat{p}^l(t^{**})$

- if there were an $l \le k$ such that $\hat{P}^l(t^{**}) = \mu(t^{**}) = b^{**}$, whoever is getting that offer $b^{**}$ is acheivable to $t^{**}$ since $\mu$ is stable and $\mu(t^{**})=b^{**}$. 
- By (1) it must be the case that whoever got that offer $\hat{\mu}^l(\hat{\mu}(t^{**})=b^{**}) = t^{**}$
- Its got to be the case by the DA Algorithm, $\hat{P}^{l+1}(t^{**}) = \mu(t^{**})$
- Then this implies $\hat{P}^k(t^{**}) = \mu(t^{**})$ but this cannot be
- We know on round $k$, $\hat{P}^k(t^{**}) = b^*$. We know that $\mu(t^*) = b^*$. So, that implies that $\mu(t^{**}) \ne b^*$ and $b^* \ne b^{**}$. 



>We know that $\hat{P}^k(t^{**}) \succ_{t^{**}} b$ for $b \ne \{\hat{P}^l(t^{**}): l = 1,2,...,k\}$ by the DA algorithm and strict preferences. 




>On round $k$ make proposal to $b^*$: $b^* = \hat{P}^k(t^{**}) \succ_{t^{**}} \mu(t^{**})$


_________________________________
__Alternatively__ _(because David is still confused by what he recorded from class above)_ MIT offers the following proof for the above:

We say that $b$ is achievable for _t_ if there is some stable matching $\mu$ with $\mu(t) = b$. For a contradiction, suppose a man ($t$) is rejected by an achievable woman $b$ at some stage of the deferred acceptance algorithm. 

Consider the first step of the algorithm in which a man $t$ is rejected by an achievable woman $b$. Let $\mu$ be a stable matching where $\mu(t) = b$. Then $b$ tentatively accepted some other man $t'$ at this step. So:

(i) $t' \succ_b t$ since this is the first time a man is rejected by an achievable woman. 
(ii) $b \succ_{t'} \mu(t')$

By (i) and (ii), $(t', b)$ blocks $\mu$, contradicting the stability of $\mu$. [^1]

__Proof of Proposition__ for $I = T$

Fix a stable match $\mu:(T \cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$. Required to prove: for each $t \in T$ agent, the $\mu_{TD}(t) \succsim_t \mu(t)$. Fix some $t \in T$ One possibility: if, for each k, $\hat{P}^k(t) \ne \mu(t)$. Does not choose best for whatever reason. In the DA Algorithm ($\mu_{TD}$)I make first offer to best, second to second best, so certainly here, $\mu_{TD}(t) \succ_t \mu(t)$


Suppose there is some $k$ such that $\hat{P}^k(t) = \mu(t)$. By Lemma 2, $\hat{\mu}^k(\mu(t)) = t \implies \hat{P}^{k+1}(t) = \hat{P}^{k}(t)$. Then, $\hat{\mu}^{k+1}(\mu(t)) = t$


Under the DA Algorithm, this implies $\mu_{TD}(t) = \mu(t)$ and certainly $\mu_{TD}(t) \succsim_t \mu(t)$ and we are done. Strict preferences are important for the result.



### Indifference

Many properties considered require that all agents have strict preferences. But, what if this isn't so? What if one agent is indifferent? In particular, can a matching be _I-Optimal_?


## Example 1

$T = \{t_1, t_2, t_3\}$ and $B = \{b_1, b_2, b_3\}$


$$t_1: b_2 \sim b_3 \succ b_1 \succ t_1$$
$$t_2: b_2 \succ b_1 \succ t_2 \succ b_3$$
$$t_3: b_3 \succ b_1 \succ t_3 \succ b_2$$





$$b_1: t_1 \succ t_2 \succ t_3 \succ b_1$$
$$b_2: t_1 \succ t_2 \succ b_2 \succ t_3$$
$$b_3: t_1 \succ t_3 \succ b_3 \succ t_2$$






If $\mu$ is stable and $t_2$ is matched, $$\mu(t_2) \in \{b_2, b_1\}$$


If $\mu$ is stable and $t_3$ is matched, $$\mu(t_3) \in \{b_3, b_1\}$$





Suppose that $\mu(t_2) = b_1$ then $\mu(t_3) = b_3 \implies \mu(t_1) = b_2$. Then, we have stable match 1. 




Another possibility: $\mu(t_2) = b_2$. Then $\mu(t_3) = b_3$ and $\mu(t_1) = b_1$. But the $(t_1, b_3)$ form a block, so that is not going to work. 


So, if $\mu(t_2) = b_2$, it must be the case that $\mu(t_3) = b_1$ and $\mu(t_1) = b_3$. Then we have stable match 2. 




In match 1, $t_3$ is pretty happy since he gets his best match. In match 2, $t_2$ gets his best. And, $b_2$ prefers match 1, but $b_3$ prefers match 2. 



This can only happen because $t_1$ is indifferent. 


So, there are no _I-Optimal_ stable matchings when one agent is indifferent. 





## Theorem (Knuth)

_Suppose preferences are strict. If $\mu$ and $\mu'$ are stable matches, then $\mu >_T \mu'$ if and only if $\mu' >_B \mu$._



__Definition__ Let $\mu': (T\cup B) \rightarrow (T \cup B)$ is an _I-Pessimal_ stable match is:

1. $\mu'$ is stable
2. And $\mu \ge_I \mu'$ for all other stable matches $\mu$. 


### Corollary

_Suppose preferences are strict. Then $\mu_{ID}$ is J-pessimal._
