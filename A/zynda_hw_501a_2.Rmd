## Problem 2.3

_If $succeq$ is a complete and trasitive preference on a finite set $X$, then $succeq$ has a utility representation_



Let $X$ be a finite set with $\succeq$ as a complete and transitive preference on the set. Then, define subsets of $X$ for each element $x \in X$ such that:

$$W(x) = \{y \in X: x \succeq y\}$$
If $X$ is finite with a complete and transitive preference relation, that means there will be a $W(x)$ since either $x \succeq y$ or $y \succeq x$ which implies $W(x) = y$ or $W(y) = x$. This works as well if $X$ is a singleton since $x \succeq x \implies W(x) = x$. 

For transitivity, as usual let $x \succeq y$ and $y \succeq z$. Because the preference is transitive, then: $x \succeq z$. Also allow for $z \succeq t$. This implies, by definition of $W(x)$ that: $W(x) = y$, $W(y) = z$, $W(z) = t$ Then, $y \succeq z$ and $z \succeq t \implies y \succeq t$.


Then for each element in the set $X$, $W(x)$ returns a set containing all the elements that are as preferred to $x$ and not as preferred to $x$. 

Define a function $u(x): W(x) \subseteq X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Let $u(x)$ return a real number representing the number of elements in $W(x) \subseteq X$. 





## Problem 3.1

_If $\succeq$ is complete, and $B$ containts just two elements then $C_\succeq(B)$ is nonempty. Conversely, if $\succeq$ is not complete, there exists some $B \subset X$ containing just two elements such that $C_\succeq(B)$ is empty. If $\succeq$ is complete and transitive, $\mathcal{B}$ and $C_{\succeq}$ satisfies finite nonemptiness_
