## Problem 1: Prove that for finite $X$, a complete and transitive $\succsim$ has a utility representation. 





Strategy: 
(1) First construct $u(x)$ 
(2) Show that $u(x)$ represents $\succsim$ i.e.:

$$x \succsim y \iff u(x) \ge u(y)$$

One way to solve this is:

$$\forall x \in X: u(x) = |\{y: y \in X, x \succsim y\}$$

Another way to solve this is using Rubenstein's way:

__Definition:__ an element $a \in X$ is minimal if $x \succsim a$ for any $x \in X$. 

__Lemma:__ If any finiste set $A \subseteq X$ There is a minimal element. 

__Proof:__ 

By induction on the size of $A$, $A$ is a singleton. By completeness, the only element is minimal. 


Assume $|A| = n$ is true. For $|A| = n+1$, let $x \in A$ then for the set of $A \setminus x$, there is a minimal element denoted by $y$. If $x \succsim y$ then $y$ is minimal in $A$. If $y \succsim x$, the by transitivity then $z \succsim x$ for all $z \in A \setminus x$ and therefore $x$ is minimal. 

### Problem: Prove that for finite $X$, a complete and transitive $\succsim$ has a utility representation.

__Proof:__ 

Contruct a seqence of sets inductively. Let $X$ be the subsets of elements that are minimal in $X$. Hence $(X_1 \ne \emptyset)$

Assume that we have constructed $X_1, ..., X_k$. Now if $X = X_1 \cup X_2 \cup ... \cup X_k$, we are done. If not, define $X_{k+1}$, the set of minimal elements in $X - X_1 - X_2 - X_3 - ... - X_k$. And by lemma $X_{k+1} \ne \emptyset$. 

Since $X_i$ is finite, we must be done after at most $|X|$ steps. Define $u(x) = k$ if $x \in X_k$. To verify that $u$ represents $\succsim$ let $a \succsim b$. Then $b \notin X - X_1 - X_2 - ... - X_{u(a)}$. 

Thus, $u(a) \ge u(b)$


## Problem 2:

(a) if $\succsim$ is complete, $B$ contains two elements $\implies C \succsim (B) \ne \emptyset$ if $\succsim$ is not complete, $B = \{x,y\}$. Since$\succsim$ is complete: x not succsim y and y not succsim x. $X \in C_{\succsim}(B), y \in C_{\succsim}(B)$

If $\succsim$ is not complete, the there exists $x, y \in X$ such that x not succsim y and y not succsim x. 


(b) $\succsim$ complete and transitive, $\mathcal{B}, C_{\succsim}(B)$ satisfies finite nonemptiness. 

We already proved that for any finite set, there exists maximum element (minimal above in prob 1) in $X$ by induction. Denote this maximal element by $X^*$. By defition, for any finite $B$,  $\exists x^* \in X$ such that for any  $y \in B$ finite, $x^* \succsim y \implies x^* \in C_{\succsim}(B)$

So, $C_{\succsim}(B) \ne \emptyset$. 



## Problem 3

$X$ is finite. Consider $C(\cdot)$ defined on all nonempty subsets of $X$. Then: there exists a complete and transitive preference $\succsim$ such that it generates the choice rule $C(\cdot)$ if and only if $C(\cdot)$ satisfies weak axiom and finite nonemptiness (Proposition 3.1b). This implies that $C_{\succsim}(\cdot)$ satisfies finite nonemptiness by proposition 3.2. Then $\succsim t \implies C_{\succsim}(\cdot)$ has weak axiom. 

So, $C(\cdot) = C_{\succsim}(\cdot)$. 


Essentially, repeat 3.3 in lecture notes. 


## Problem 4 (3.3) 


$X = \{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ is a finite set of prices of wine with lower the price lower the subscript on $x$. 

(a) Ann always chooses the cheapest bottle. Is her choice rule rationalizable?

First answer yes or no. If yes, then define a preference. Then, show that it is complete and transitive. Show that the choice rule generated by this preference is equal to Ann's original choice rule ($C_{\succsim}(\cdot) = C_A(\cdot)$)

The preference Ann has is: $x_i \succsim x_j$ if $i \le j$. So, it is complete. It is transitive (easy to show). For any $B$ the choice rule $C_{\succsim}(B) = \{x_{i^*}\}$ where $i^* = \min \{i:X_i \in B\}$

Then $C_A(B) = \{x_{i^*}\}$ and $C_A(B) = C_{\succsim}(B)$


(b) Bob's choice rule second cheapest in a set. Show that his preference does not fulfill weakness axiom. This would then imply that his choice is not rationalizable. 

Consider $B = \{x_1, x_2, x_3\}$ and $B' = \{x_2, x_3, x_4\}$. 



Bob chooses $x_2$ in $B$ and $x_3$ in $B'$ So, it violates the weakness axiom. 

(c) Also not rationalizable since in one set she could choose an $x_i$ but another set she chooses nothing. 


## Problem 5

Consider single valued choice rule. 

(i) $C(\cdot)$ satisfies WA. 
(ii) $x, y \in B, B'$ and $x \ne y$ if $C(B) = x \implies C(B') \ne y$
(iii) $x, y \in B, C(B) = x, c(B') = y \implies x \notin B'$.


(i) to (ii):

WARP states that if $x$ is revealed at least as good as $y$, then $y$ cannot be revealed preferred to $x$. Then $x,y \in B: x \in C(B) \implies x \succsim y$. And if $y \notin C(B) \implies x \succ y$. 

So, if $y \in C(B')$ then you cannot have $x$ in this choice set. 



(ii) to (iii): Proof by contradiction. Suppose $x \in B, y \in B, C(B) = x$
